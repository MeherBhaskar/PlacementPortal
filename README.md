# PlacementPortal

The following website is developed for the benefit of students, student clubs, companies
coming for placements and the college placement authorities in a college during the placement
season. This is also a secure website as the webpages would not be accessible directly using
links without logging in first. Any attempt to view to a page reachable only after signing in
without first logging in will lead to redirection to the corresponding login page.

## It is basically divided into three parts namely â€“

### Student Portal

### Company Portal

### Admin Portal

### Admin Portal is further sub divided into
#### Portal for Master Admin i.e. the placement authorities of the college
#### Portal for club presidents


## MODULES IMPLEMENTED:
### Student Portal

This portal is for the students to use. A final year student can register and view various details
of all the companies coming for placements that year. Along with that the students can also
check their eligibility for each of the companies and register for the companies accordingly.
The OT and process dates can also be seen and when sorted upon that column, the same
gridview can be used as the calendar.
The student also has an option to upload the resume, which can be updated any number of
times, for the recruiter to see.

### Company Portal

This portal is for the companies coming for placements. They have to register on the portal and
get their unique ID number which is used for any further logins on the website by the company.
After successful login each company can view the list of students who applied fort that
company and further view all the student clubs present in the college. They also have an option
to view the resumes of students who registered for that particular company. Along with the
resume of a student, all the details of all the groups the student is part can be seen.

### Master Admin Portal

This portal is for the placement cell authorities. Here the admin can view, add any new
group/club or delete any existing group as per his choice. Along with that he has the option to
view the details of any student or company registered on the website. Any student or company
who wants to edit their information has to contact him for the changes.

### Club Presidents Portal
This portal is for the presidents of the student clubs present in the college. The master admin
retains the right of creating and adding the club details to the database and he selects the
president of that particular club as the admin for that group. The president in turn has the
option to add or delete any members from that club. He also has an option to transfer his rights
to another member of that club.
